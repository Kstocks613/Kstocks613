/*
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. 
How old would you be if you were a dog?
Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to dog years.

//This is my age 
var myAge = 22;

//This variable will change 
var earlyYears = 2;

//This is reassigning earlyYears and checking to make sure it works (It does)
earlyYears = earlyYears * 10;


//This will * laterYears by 4 
var laterYears = myAge - 2; 
laterYears = laterYears * 4;

//adding earlyYears and laterYears together 
var myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//This makes my whole name lowercase 

myName = 'Kyler Stocks'.toLowerCase();


/*This will write a statement showing my name, age, and age in dog years
*/

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. 
I am ${myAge } years old in human years 
which is ${myAgeInDogYears}.`);
